# Personal Survey Form
This survey form was made at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) as a part of the [responsive web design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). It is a simple survey form where I use the following elements:

- Inputs
- Select with different Options
- Radio type Inputs
- Checkbox type Inputs
- Textareas
- Submit type Inputs

I also worked with different attributes as:

- Ids
- Types
- Values
- Names
- Placeholders
- Fors
- Required
- Min & Max

For the looks of the survey I used a CSS document connected to the HTML where I defined the IDs and other attribute customizations.
